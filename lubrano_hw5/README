ex13: Lighting

Demonstrates basic lighting using a piston

This project took around 8 hours
	- Finding the norms for a cylinder was hard
	- nobody had a simple formula
	- i tried a thousand things, i finally got it

I created this because I wanted to demonstrate how light affects
	multiple objects. The piston will rise and fall.
	This changes the distance in the Y axis.
	I chose round objects because I wanted to show how light goes around the objects, trough the objects, etc.
