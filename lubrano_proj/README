FINAL PROJECT: NEW ORLEANS

Welcome to New Orleans! New Orleans is a great city with plenty of rich history and a life that doesn't stop. For my final project I wanted to recreate my home city. One of the biggest aspects to the city is the ferry that runs along the Mississippi. If you look closely, you can see the ferry travel the waters, bouncing along the waves. If you look around the city, you see various buildings that come in many different styles. At the heart of the city is the Superdome. The New Orleans Superdome is the home to one of the best sports teams out there - the Saints. By pressing 'k' you can see the inside of the superdome, the field, and the seatings. Notice the structure of the sides of the dome, the convex sides. That is how the dome stays on the top. By pressing 'o' you will see the night life of New Orleans. Whenever the Saints win their game or during Mardi Gras (press 'h') and  you will see several color fireworks light up the night sky.

I tried implementing some music tracks that are from the city of New Orleans. If you look throughout the code, you will see several libraries that are commented out. OpenAL and irrKlang are the two that I tried using. I couldn't get irrKlang working because after reading documentation it was noted that it had to be done in c++. I switched to OpenAL, but the documentation was hard to read. Even just the simple examples seemed overwhelming to add in a song. It was enough to learn about OpenGL, much less in the final moments learn an entire audio platform.

If asked "What grade do I think I deserve on this project and in this class?" I would respond with "an A." Despite losing a lot of work on the last friday before the due date, working inbetween my work schedule, and working countless hours into the night during the weekend to make up for lost work which lead to neglecting time from exams, I still was missing work that I am upset will not be in the final submittal. After the project review, I took the constructed criticims and made a city that was almost as lively as my home city. However, I feel as though the work that I caught up to will make up for that. All in all, I spent a hefty amount of time on this project. From the time of SSD crashing to this point, of catching up to the work, I spent roughly 20 hours. Keep in mind I had projects, a job, and homework due for four other classes today. That says a lot about my dedication and commitment to getting this project back to how it was.

This class really broadened my perspective of not only complex graphical programs, but also aspects of art and CAD modeling. My previous degree is in architecture and I have done professional work using many CAD softwares such as Inventor, Solidworks, and Revit. Taking this class has really opened my mind to the complexity of these programs. In Architectural design (what I have done previously) drawing a building can be done fairly quick and easy with the software provided. Throughout this class I constantly related things to my previous background. Textures, lighting, shadows, and the sheer amount of graphics that are implemented is really mind boggling.

The simple task of building a wall in OpenGL can be easy or complex. For a simple wall there is not much other than drawing six quads. For more complex cases, there are normals, shadows, lighting, perspective, and many other apsects that have to be taken into account. When using CAD software, I can easily build a wall and then press a button for it to display with all of these things taken into account. I had no idea the amount of graphic programming that actually went into place.

I know that with my time constraints and the hard drive failing that I was set back almost everything - but with all into account I am proud of it and feel like it is A-worthy work. Everything that I had implemented since the design review is on a SSD that will not boot. I even tried it on my desktop and I got nothing. It turns on then there is this faint *click* and it gives me a "can not load OS screen". Hopefully my appriciation of graphics and my dedication to this project would be enough to give me an A on this project.
